[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/gnzlbg/hm3.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gnzlbg/hm3) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/gnzlbg/hm3/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/gnzlbg/hm3)

HM&#179; (or hmmm) is a library for implementing massively-parallel numerical
methods for solving systems of PDEs, as well as for coupling these
together to tackle complex multi-physics multi-scale problems.

It is released under the [Boost Software License (Version 1.0)](license.md).

For more information please refer to its [documentation](http://gnzlbg.github.io/hm3/documentation).

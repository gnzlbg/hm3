## Signed-distance field transformations

To transform a signed-distance field one can just apply the inverse
transformation to the point before evaluating the signed-distance field.

Transformations available:

- translation to a point
- rotation around the origin (2D/3D only)
- rotation around an arbitrary axis (3D only)

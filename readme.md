# HM&sup3;: Hierarchical Multi-physics Multi-scale Methods

[![Travis build status][travis-shield]][travis] [![Coveralls.io code coverage][coveralls-shield]][coveralls] [![Docs][docs-shield]][docs]

HM&sup3; is a library for implementing massively-parallel numerical methods to
solve systems of hyperbolic/parabolic partial-differential equations (for now)
on hierarchical grids, as well as for coupling these numerical methods together
to tackle complex multi-physics multi-scale problems.

It is released under the [Boost Software License (Version 1.0)][license].

For more information please refer to its [documentation][docs].
